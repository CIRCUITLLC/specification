# HSDA Orchestration

```{eval-rst}
The HSDA orchestration protocol is defined by `openapi-hsda-orchestration.yaml <../../_static/openapi-hsda-orchestration.yaml>`_. The details below show the available methods and responses. 
```

This is a HSDA sevice specifically intended to manage orchestration around HSDA operations, enabling the system to become a two-way street, pushing data outside individual implementations. The system uses webhooks, and events to understand changes made to the HSDA system, and the data stored within.


```{eval-rst}
You can also `explore this using our OpenAPI viewer <../../_static/swagger/?url=../openapi-hsda-orchestration.yaml>`_. 

.. warning::
    
    This is an experimental feature. Feedback is welcome to shape its further development.
