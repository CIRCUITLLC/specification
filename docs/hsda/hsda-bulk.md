# HSDA Bulk

```{eval-rst}
The HSDA bulk protocol is defined by `openapi-hsda-bulk.yaml <../../_static/openapi-hsda-bulk.yaml>`_. The details below show the available methods and responses. 
```

This is a service for handling bulk loading of data into any HSDA service, allowing each POST and PUT to be queued up as a job, and be run on schedule, or based upon other events.

```{eval-rst}
You can also `explore this using our OpenAPI viewer <../../_static/swagger/?url=../openapi-hsda-bulk.yaml>`_. 

.. warning::
    
    This is an experimental feature. Feedback is welcome to shape its further development.
