    :class: hint

    .. markdown::

    * Applications should always support GET, but may choose whether or not to support POST. PUT and DELETE requests;
    * Each resource is named after a table in HSDS, and field names and definitions follow HSDS definitions;
    * Most resources have a /complete/ version which should be populated with content from linked tables to provide consumers with access to contextually relevant data;
