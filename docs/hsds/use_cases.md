Open Referral's agenda is set by the prerogatives of a set of four types of users: 
* help seekers;
* service providers;
* researchers/analysts;
* database administrators. 

 Read more about each of these personas in [our Types of Use / User Personas documentation](https://docs.openreferral.org/en/latest/initiative/index.html?highlight=types%20of%20use#types-of-use-and-user-personas). 

Practically speaking, *database administrators are the primary type of user* of HSDS and associated tools. It is still important to understand the needs of other types of users – as database administrators work to meet such needs – so we filter our understanding of end users' needs through the lense of data administrators' perspectives.
