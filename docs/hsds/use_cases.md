Open Referral's agenda is shaped by the prerogatives of four types of users: 
* help seekers;
* service providers;
* researchers/analysts;
* database administrators. 

 Read more about each of these types of users in [the User Personas documentation](https://docs.openreferral.org/en/latest/initiative/index.html#types-of-use-and-user-personas).
