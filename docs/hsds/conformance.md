Conformance and Profiles
=========================

The goal of HSDS is to provide a common model for Human Services data, so that it may be consumed and used consistently by humans and systems. Therefore we set out these principles for conforming to the standard.

The nature of Human Services inevitably results in variations between different local or regional contexts. HSDS accounts for this by explicitly creating space for different **Profiles** of HSDS to respond to local needs. A publication may be conformant either to HSDS as specified in this reference, or to a HSDS Profile.
