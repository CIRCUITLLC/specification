# Lock docutils because in docs/conf.py we do some messing around with docutils internals in a hacky way.
# Upgrading docutils has in the past broken this, so let's keep on a locked version to avoid future breaks.
# (Hacky way? See tables on /hsds/reference/ and how they are generated with ListTable.build_table_from_list)
# Picked 0.16 because sphinx-rtd-theme (0.5 at time of writing this comment) needs 0.16 or lower.
docutils>=0.16,<0.17

# Keep to version 0.5 at the moment because the next version (1.0) has some breaking changes to the navigation menu
sphinx-rtd-theme>=0.5,<0.6
